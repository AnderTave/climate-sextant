# Climate Sextant 🔭🌦🌫🌈

*Climate Sextant* is a multi sensorial immersive VR experience to explore air pollution in Lugano, Switzerland.
Born as an experiment around the possibilities of data visualization in Virtual Reality, the project propose to the user an “empty space” where data is represented only by colors and sounds.

Take your VR headset and try it at [andertave.github.io/climate-sextant](https://andertave.github.io/climate-sextant/) !

## The Idea 💡

*Climate Sextant* shows the monthly concentration of PM10 in the Lugano area, in the 2016, correlated to the precipitation level and the temperature. Darker is the sky, higher is concentration of PM10 in the air. Higher is the sound of the rain, more intense are the precipitations. A specific sound identify each season, to help the user to navigate the space.
By exploring the immersive environment, the person is enabled to understand the direct correlation among the data.
