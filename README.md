## The Idea

We would like to enable people to explore the weather and polution data through a VR experience.
During the experience the user can view accros a period the data of:
* PM10
* Rain
* Temperature

## Development

The first attempt was creating a world in which the user by rotating can see the different slice, which represent time frame.
Each slice show the pm10 with the dimension of an element, the temperature that modify the color of the sky and the precipitation is given by the sound.
